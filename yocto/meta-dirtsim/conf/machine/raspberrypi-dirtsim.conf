#@TYPE: Machine
#@NAME: Dirtsim Unified Raspberry Pi (Pi4 + Pi5)
#@DESCRIPTION: Unified machine configuration for Sparkle Duck supporting both
#              Raspberry Pi 4 (with Miuzei HDMI display) and
#              Raspberry Pi 5 (with HyperPixel 4.0 DPI display).

# Inherit raspberrypi4 overrides so the kernel BSP metadata is found.
# This tells recipes that need machine-specific configs to use Pi4 settings.

# Use Cortex-A72 tuning. This runs correctly on both Pi4 (A72) and Pi5 (A76).
# A76 is backwards compatible with A72 code.
